                  <p>How to keep a clean house...YOU MUST clean every day. Yes, this is true. You need to clean daily. Don't let this overwhelm you, this does not mean you need to clean your house from top to bottom every single dayâ€¦. That would be exhausting. Daily cleaning should include things like cleaning counters, making sure things are picked up from the floor, taking out the trash, sweep/vacuum, wash dishes and finding one extra thing to accomplish that day. (i.e. Deep clean one thing or one room, dust, organize) Every other day: *Daily Cleaning routine plus mop floors, and deep clean bathroom (i.e. wipe down mirrors, clean counters/sink, scrub toilet, disinfect, take out trash. (Don't do a deep clean in another room, this is your deep clean.) Weekly cleaning should include *Daily Cleaning routine plus wash all bedding. Do scrub your bath or shower once a week. **Make sure to include wash laundry as needed.</p>

                  <p>These cleaning tools make cleaning a breeze! Bissell Crosswave- A must have for people with hardwood floors. This cleaner mops and vacuums at the same time! I personally own one and it has cut down my time from 1 hour of sweeping and mopping to about 20 minutes. It also self-cleans and has a charging dock. Next recommendation and the best thing since sliced bread!!! Is the ROOMBA robot vacuum. This thing is awesome, it vacuums your whole house for you with a couple clicks on your phone. Now the setup takes a little time, you have to map the rooms in your house and label each one so you can select the ones you want cleaned at anytime. The best part is you can even have it clean while your gone. Just got that message that someone will be over after church?? No worries send a command to clean before you get home! 
                    Of course there are other basics such as a large dishwasher to not only clean but get the clutter put away, Scrub daddy sponges, Mr. Magic eraser cleaner, clorox wipes, and my new favorits dawn spray. These things will change your life!  </p>

                  <p>How to organize... Start with one room or a section of the room. For example if you are needing to organize your bedroom, you might want to start with your room itself, then later the closet, desk, etc.
                    1)Take stuff out of the space you are cleaning and declutter while doing this, make a pile of things that need to be thrown away, and a pile for things that need to be relocated. 2) Next clean the area you just removed stuff from. 3) Once you have a clean area start putting stuff back in a neat way, use bins, organizers, labels, and put similar items together. 4) Once that area is fully clean and how you want it, move on to the next. 5) Once you have decluttered and organized all your rooms it will be much easier for you to remember where things go, this will help you to put away things (Don't delay on putting things away- it will pile up). Having your home organized and decluttered makes clean up faster and also makes it easier for you to take inventory of the things you have and are getting low on.  </p>
