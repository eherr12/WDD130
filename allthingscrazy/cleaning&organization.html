                How to keep a clean house #1) You must clean every day. Yes, this is true. You need to clean daily. Don't let this overwhelm you, this does not mean you need to clean your house from top to bottom every single day…. That would be exhausting. Daily cleaning should include things like cleaning counters, making sure things are picked up from the floor, taking out the trash, sweep/vacuum, wash dishes and finding one extra thing to accomplish that day. (i.e. Deep clean one thing or one room, dust, organize) Every other day: *Daily Cleaning routine plus mop floors, and deep clean bathroom (i.e. wipe down mirrors, clean counters/sink, scrub toilet, disinfect, take out trash. (Don't do a deep clean in another room, this is your deep clean.) Weekly cleaning should include *Daily Cleaning routine plus wash all bedding. Do scrub your bath or shower once a week. **Make sure to include wash laundry as needed. #2) #3) Cleaning tools Check out these cleaning tools that make cleaning a breeze! Bissell Crosswave- A must have for people with hardwood floors. I personally own one and it has cut down my time from 1 hour to about 20 minutes. Not only do I love that my cleaning time has been cut down but I also don’t have to sweep, then fill a bucket with water and rinse that nasty wet mop! The Bissell Crosswave vacuums and mops the floor at the same time, has a trigger to hold for sticky messes, and the best part of all it wrings itself on while on its charging dock!
