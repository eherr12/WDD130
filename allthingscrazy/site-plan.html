        [Hi! Welcome to Allthingscrazy. My name is Emily, a stay at home mom who decided to create this space to share craft ideas, recipes, activities, cleaning & organization tips, and posts about everyday life. My goal is that you takeaway something fun and inspiring from this site to help you and your family create a nice life balance, whatever that may be.
        
        The most wonderful holidays are right around the corner! I am so excited to gather with friends and family. I recently just came across the idea of cookie DIY kits, and let me tell you I am so intrigued! I had to reach out to my sister-in-law who has become my project buddy (love it!) Let's just say I didn't have to tell her twice! 
        Today we gathered our materials and were on a mission to "stage" our cookie kits, because we feast through our eyes first of course! This is what we ended up with! Now for some fun verbiage... and we are ready to post for selling! These cookie kits are so fun to put together and fun for kiddos to decorate. 
        They are super easy to make for any holiday: 
        1) Switch out the cookie cutters for Snowflakes, Trees, Candycane and your ready for Christmas! 
        2) Change up the frosting colors to match the holiday you are celebrating.
        3) Match your sprinkles and ribbon! 


        Here's a link to the sugar cookie recipe we used!

        [How to keep a clean house

        #1) You must clean every day. Yes, this is true. You need to clean daily. 
        Don't let this overwhelm you, this does not mean you need to clean your house from top to bottom every single day…. That would be exhausting. 
        
        Daily cleaning should include things like cleaning counters, making sure things are picked up from the floor, taking out the trash, sweep/vacuum, wash dishes and finding one extra thing to accomplish that day.
        (i.e. Deep clean one thing or one room, dust, organize)
        
        Every other day: *Daily Cleaning routine plus mop floors, and deep clean bathroom (i.e. wipe down mirrors, clean counters/sink, scrub toilet, disinfect, take out trash.  
        (Don't do a deep clean in another room, this is your deep clean.)
        
        Weekly cleaning should include *Daily Cleaning routine plus wash all bedding. 
        Do scrub your bath or shower once a week. 
        
        **Make sure to include wash laundry as needed.

        Check out these cleaning tools that make cleaning a breeze!
        
        Bissell Crosswave- A must have for people with hardwood floors. I personally own one and it has cut down my time from 1 hour to about 20 minutes. Not only do I love that my cleaning time has been cut down but I also don’t have to sweep, then fill a bucket with water and rinse that nasty wet mop! The Bissell Crosswave vacuums and mops the floor at the same time, has a trigger to hold for sticky messes, and the best part of all it wrings itself on while on its charging dock!
