            The most wonderful holidays are right around the corner! I am so excited to gather with friends and family. I recently just came across the idea of cookie DIY kits, and let me tell you I am so intrigued! I had to reach out to my sister-in-law who has become my project buddy (love it!) Let's just say I didn't have to tell her twice! 
            Today we gathered our materials and were on a mission to "stage" our cookie kits, because we feast through our eyes first of course! 
            This is what we ended up with! Now for some fun verbiage... and we are ready to post for selling! These cookie kits are so fun to put together and fun for kiddos to decorate. 
            They are super easy to make for any holiday: 
            </p>

          
            <li>Switch out the cookie cutters for Snowflakes, Trees, Candycane and your ready for Christmas! </li>
            <li>Change up the frosting colors to match the holiday you are celebrating.</li> 
            <li>Match your sprinkles and ribbon! </li>
           
            </p>
